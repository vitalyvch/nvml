This directory contains a tool which traces syscalls in a fast
way using eBPF linux kernel feature.

** DEPENDENCIES: **
The strace.ebpf depends on libbcc library:

$ sudo apt-get install libbcc

Bcc sources:

https://github.com/iovisor/bcc

** WARNING **

Some old libbcc packages require manual coping of libbcc.pc from sources to
appropriate place in a system. In case of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS appropriate place
is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libbcc.pc.
