Why we need new tool
---------------------

 - regular system tracing tools are slow
 - regular tools slowdown traced application for few orders
 - output of regular tools is human-oriented and don't assume automated
   processing
 - overcoming above problems in regular way require:

   - kernel hacking (sysdig)
   - special HW (Lauterbach).


Used technologies
------------------

 - eBPF
 - KProbe
 - Perf Event Circular Buffer
 - event-loop


System requirements
--------------------

 - libbcc
 - Linux Kernel 4.4 (for Perf Event Circular Buffer)
 - CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for bpf() syscall
 - mounted tracefs


Pros
-----

    - Used combination of technologies allow tool to be about one order faster
      than regular system strace.
    - This tool consume much less amount of CPU resource
    - Output of this tool is designed to be suiteable for processing with
      classical tools and technologies, like awk.
    - Could trace syscalls system-wide.


Cons
-----

    - Limited functionality
    - Slow attaching and detaching
    - Asyncronity. If user will not provide enough system resources for
      performace tool will skip some calls. Tool does not assume to try
      any work-around behind the scene.

Conclusion
-----------

 - we reached performance about 1000000 syscalls per second.
 - there is places for future optimization.
